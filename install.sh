#  1. Installs:
#    - xcode
#    - homebrew
#    - ansible (via brew) 
#    - a few ansible galaxy playbooks (zsh, homebrew, cask etc)  
#  2. Kicks off the ansible playbook:
#    - main.yml
#
# It begins by asking for your sudo password:

fancy_echo() {

  # shellcheck disable=SC2059
  printf "\n$fmt\n" "$@"
}

fancy_echo "Boostrapping ..."
